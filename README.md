Selection of samples.
Based on sex, mutation and cells. 
Selected donor IDs - CH-21/20-XXX
- 002, 013, 020, 031 - Healthy donors two males and two females with the most cells.
- 006 (female), 046 (male), 014 and 033 (males with TET2 with most cells). They are chosen because they have the most individual cells. 
- 004, 037, 034, 029 - these donors only had NAs in the DNASeq data but had the most cells.
