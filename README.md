Selection of samples: 
Based on sex, mutation and cells 
Selected donor IDs CH-21-XXX
- 002, 013, 020, 031 - Healthy donors two males and two females with the most cells. We chose both sexes to perform integration. 
- 006 (woman), 046 (male with DNMT3A), 014 and 033 (males with TET2 with most cells) - these samples are chosen because they have data on somatic mutations in individual cells.
- 004, 037, 034, 029 (These donors only had NAs from the DNA-Seq but had the most cells)
